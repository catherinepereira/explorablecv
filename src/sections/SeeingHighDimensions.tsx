          Reducing 512 dimensions to 2 or 3 dimensions would discard most of the
          information in the embedding, so the goal is to keep the most useful
          parts.{" "}

          It builds a graph of each point's nearest neighbors in the full 512D
          space, then arranges that graph in 2D or 3D such that related points
          stay close together. A tight cluster in the plot at the top of this
          page is a group of tracks that had similar CLAP vectors, which usually
          means they sound alike or had similar qualities.

        <p>
          However, a cluster being on the left versus the right does not have
          meaning in the graphical representation of the embeddings, nor does
          the absolute distance between points or clusters. What matters is the
          relative tightness of the clusters and relative distance between
          points or clusters, as compared to the entire space that the vector
          space takes up.

            the overall layout is preserved at the cost of local detail.
