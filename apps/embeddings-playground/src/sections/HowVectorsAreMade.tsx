          (Contrastive Language-Audio Pretraining). It was trained on audio-text
          pairs with the objective to give a clip and its caption similar
          vectors, and give a clip and a caption that don't match dissimilar
          vectors. Over many pairs, the audio encoder learns to represent the
          qualities that captions describe, such as tempo, timbre, and genre.

          The model was never given genre labels directly. It learned that clips
          with jazz-like captions get similar vectors, so it gives new jazz
          clips similar vectors too.
